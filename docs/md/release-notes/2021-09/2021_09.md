## Ability to highlight variants of interest

VCF files may include a large number of variants and it might be helpful to highlight variants of interest based on specific values of their attributes.

Now, system admin can create/edit the special JSON-file (`interest_profiles.json`) where a list of condition profiles is being described.  
Each profile in that file contains an own set of conditions based on the variant attributes. For a condition, the color is being specified.

At the GUI, any user can enable the highlight feature from the **Settings** (**VCF** tab) and select any profile from the described file:

In the variants table, if the variant is satisfy to the certain condition of the selected profile - variant row will be highlighted in that condition color:

Also at the VCF track, if the variant is satisfy to the certain condition of the selected profile - this variant will be highlighted in that condition color:
