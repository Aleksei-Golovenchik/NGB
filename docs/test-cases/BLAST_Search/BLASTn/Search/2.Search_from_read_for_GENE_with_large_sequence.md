# BLASTn search from read (GENE)

Test verifies
 - BLASTn search from GENE track with large sequence
**Prerequisites**:

dataset = **dm6_data**, .bam = **[agnts3.09-28.trim.dm606.realign.bam](https://ngb-oss-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/public/data/demo/ngb_demo_data/agnts3.09-28.trim.dm606.realign.bam.gz)**
.vcf = **[agnts3.09-28.trim.dm606.realign.vcf](https://ngb-oss-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/public/data/demo/ngb_demo_data/agnts3.09-28.trim.dm606.realign.vcf.gz)**

| Steps | Actions | Expected results |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Login to NGB | |
| 2 | Go to  **Variants** panel | |
| 3 | Find Variation on Position **chr ?**|  |
| 4 | Click on Variation on Position **chr ?**| BAM and VCF tracks are opened in the Browser window |
| 5 | Go to GENE track| | 
| 6 | Click on GENE alignment **specific or any**? | Context menu is displayed <li> **BLASTn Search** and **BLASTp Search** display between **BLAST Search** and **Copy info to clipboard** |
| 7 | Click on **BLASTn Search** in the context menu | <li> The corresponding error message is displaed (as pop-up?), e.g. "Selected feature is too large to be used as a query sequence." <li> The BLAST panel is not opened|
