Test verifies
 - search of any sequence type by open a new BLAST panel from Views and specify manually all desired search settings

| 1 | Login to NGB | |
| 2 | Go to  **Views** menu on the main toolbar| <li> **Views** menu is displayed <li> New **BLAST** panel is displayed in the Views menu |
| 3 | Select **BLAST** panel | <li>**BLAST** panel is displayed first at the right side in the additional panels <li> **BLAST** panel has 2 sub-tabs: **Search** and **History** <li> **Search** sub-tab is opened by default |
| 4 | Look at **Search** tab| <li> **blastn** search selector chosen by default <li> **Query sequence** field is blank <li> **Task title** field is blank <li> **** value displays in the **Database** field by default <li> **Organism** field is blank <li> **megablast** value is displayed in **Algorithm** field by default  <li> **Additional parameters** section is collapsed 
| 5 | Enter value in the **Query sequence** field | | 
| 6 | Enter any title in the **Task title** field | | 
| 7 | Select **** in the **Database** field|| 
| 8 | Type **** and select **** in the **Organism** field| |
| 9| Click on **Search** button|  <li> Search is started <li> **History** sub-tab is opened automatically |
| 10|  Look at **History** sub-tab | <li> A new search task created  <li> New task ID is auto generated <li> Title of the certain search task (if it was specified before the search) displays in the **Task title** column <li> Current state is **Searching...** <li>  Date and time when the certain search was started is displayed in the **Submitted at** column <li> Duration of the certain search task displays in the **Duration** column <li> button to cancel search (conventionally shown by a cross-button) displays to the right of the  <li>  button to open the search again in the "Search" sub-tab (conventionally shown by a reverse arrow-button) |

| 12| Click on last search id in the **Task ID** column | <li> The corresponding results is opened in the same **History** sub-tab <li> **Blast parameters** collapsible section (collapsed by default) is displayed <li> Search results are displayed in the table of **History** sub-tab above **Blast parameters** section
| 13| Click on the first sequence ID in the **Sequence ID** column  | <li> the form with details about all matches (alignments) of the search query to the certain sequence is opened <li> "Alignments" form is opened in the same tab ("History") |
| 14| Click on **View at track** button for the first alighnment |The pop-up for an alignment of the nucleotide sequence is appered |
| 15| Go back to Search results page on the NGB| 
| 16| Click on **Sequence ID** link |  Corresponding sequence page on NCBI is opened (if exists)|
